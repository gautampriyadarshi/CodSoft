        <br><br><br>
        <p>Samuel Harris Altman (born April 22, 1985) is an American entrepreneur and investor best known as the CEO of OpenAI since 2019 (he was briefly fired and reinstated in November 2023).
          Altman is considered to be one of the leading figures of the AI boom.
          He dropped out of university after two years and founded Loopt, a mobile social networking service, raising more than $30 million in venture capital. 
          In 2011 Altman joined Y Combinator, a startup accelerator, and was its president from 2014 to 2019.
          Altman's journey into entrepreneurship began when he decided to depart from traditional academia after completing two years of university education. 
          He embarked on his entrepreneurial path by founding Loopt, a pioneering mobile social networking service.

      <h3>Early life and education</h3>
      <p>
          Samuel Harris Altman was born on April 22, 1985, in Chicago, Illinois, into a Jewish family, and grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. 
          His mother is a dermatologist, while his father was a real estate broker. 
          Altman is the eldest of four siblings—brothers Jack and Max, and sister Annie. At the age of eight he received his first computer, an Apple Macintosh. 
          He attended John Burroughs School, a private school in Ladue, Missouri. 
          In 2005, after two years at Stanford University studying computer science, he dropped out without earning a bachelor's degree.

      <h3>Career</h3>
      <p>
        In 2005, at the age of 19, Altman co-founded Loopt, a location-based social networking mobile application. 
        As CEO, Altman raised more than $30 million in venture capital for the company; however, Loopt failed to gain traction with enough users. 
        In March 2012, it was acquired by the Green Dot Corporation for $43.4 million. 
        The following month, Altman co-founded Hydrazine Capital with his brother, Jack Altman.

        OpenAI was initially funded by Altman, Greg Brockman, Elon Musk, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, Infosys, and YC Research. 
        When OpenAI launched in 2015, it had raised $1 billion. In March 2019, Sam Altman left Y Combinator to focus full-time on OpenAI as CEO.
        By the summer of 2019, he had helped raise $1 billion from Microsoft. Altman testified before the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, 
        Technology and the Law on 16 May 2023 about issues of AI oversight. After the success of ChatGPT, Altman made a world tour in May 2023, where he visited 22 countries and met multiple leaders and diplomats, 
        including British prime minister Rishi Sunak, French president Emmanuel Macron, Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez, German chancellor Olaf Scholz, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol, and Israeli president Isaac Herzog. 
        He stood for a photo with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.

      <h3>Personal life</h3>
      <p>
        Altman has been a vegetarian since childhood.
        He is gay and came out at the age of 17 in high school, where he spoke out after some students objected to a National Coming Out Day speaker. He dated Loopt co-founder Nick Sivo for nine years; they broke up shortly after the company was acquired in 2012.
        Altman married engineer Oliver Mulherin in January 2024, at their estate in Hawaii; the pair live in San Francisco's Russian Hill neighborhood and often spend weekends in Napa, California.
        He is a prepper; Altman said in 2016: "I have guns, gold, potassium iodide, antibiotics, batteries, water, gas masks from the Israel Defense Forces, and a big patch of land in Big Sur I can fly to.
